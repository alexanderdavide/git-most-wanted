# Development Container Definitions

This folder contains a set of development container configuration files or "definitions" that are included with the [Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers) extension and [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). This list is presented if you select the **Add Development Container Definition Files...** command from the command pallette (<kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd> or <kbd>F1</kbd>) in VS Code. In Remote - Containers, the list also appears open a folder in a container that does not already have a `.devcontainer.json` or `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

Each folder contains a README with more details on the contents of the definition and how to use it.
